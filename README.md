Summary: With the 5th project, I was able to create a successful work schedule website that is user interactive. This website is containing my html, css design and javascript code. I have continued to learn and grow my HTML skill and trying to perfect it. My HTML elements are composed of different structures, positions and styles for the work schedule for the website. The HTML and CSS for the develop was given to use in the assignment, however we have to make our own through the main folder I made. As you see the CSS design for my website contains the work schedule creating the composition layout of the hours, colors of past, present and notifications for daily activities. Crafting the JavaScript with the poissible characters to the different variables, functions and arrays. I continue to watch numerous youtube videos and zoom recordings on the UNC bootcamp website. I have reached out to my ASKBCS, TAs during my office hours, my intructor during class hours and my acaedmic advisors to get all the proper knowledge from the resources I am provided. This 5th project was a great opportunity to continously craft my visual studio coding projects and keep perfecting my craft.
